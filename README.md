### Roof terrace:

Transformation of a 1614 square feet roof terrace  in Paris 75016.
It was a double objective: not to destroy the existing by taking inspiration from the Haussmann style and to produce a vegetal project.

### Renovation and restructuring of an apartment:


I am happy to have been able to participate in all phases of production for this 1829 square feet apartment in Paris 75007. 
With the help of REVIT, I did the preliminary project summary (APS), the final draft (APD) and finally the business consultation file (DCE). The project is currently under construction.
