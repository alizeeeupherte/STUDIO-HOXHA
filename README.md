### Roof terrace:

Transformation of a 1614 square feet roof terrace  in Paris 75016.
It was a double objective: not to destroy the existing by taking inspiration from the Haussmann style and to produce a vegetal project.

### Renovation and restructuring of an apartment:


I am happy to have been able to participate in all phases of production for this 1829 square feet apartment in Paris 75007. 
With the help of REVIT, I did the preliminary project summary (APS), the final draft (APD) and finally the business consultation file (DCE). The project is currently under construction.

### Moreover:
I am involved in the site supervision of the building and in toutch with all the differents actors on the project. Here is a rehabilitation of building destined to housing of 6243 square feet in Daguerre street Paris 75014.

I participated in the written documents for the delivery  of the building permit of 7965 square feet regarding 8 dwellings in Saint Maur Des Fossés, France. This project allowed me to learn how to fill out official documents for the Registration and Review Center of Administrative Forms in French called « Cerfa », as well as all the other administrative procedures involved.
Same for a 3229 square feet Poker Club in Paris, 75008.
Participation in the production of images: elevations, cuts of a fish shop of 1001 square feet in Trouville sur Mer, France.




##### All projects are supervised by partners Laert Hoxha and Patrick Bertrand - STUDIO HOXHA
